We provide compiled CSS (`metro-bootstrap.css`) in the dist folder, as well as compiled and minified CSS (`metro-bootstrap.min.css`).

## Installing Dependencies

We manage dependencies using Bower.
Run `bower install` to download the required dependencies.

If don't have Grunt installed, execute the following steps from the command line:

1. Make sure you have node.js installed.
2. Install bower with `npm install -g bower`.

## Compiling CSS

We compile metro-bootstrap using [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/).
Run `grunt build` to compile the CSS into `/dist`.

If don't have Grunt installed, execute the following steps from the command line:

1. Make sure you have node.js installed.
2. Install `grunt-cli` globally with `npm install -g grunt-cli`.
3. Go to the `metro-bootstrap` directory, then run `npm install`. npm will look at package.json and automatically install the necessary dependencies.
